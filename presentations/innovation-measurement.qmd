# R & D 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Long Time Series

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Decomposable (Type of Research, Org)

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Available at Firm Level

<!-- Advantages:
long time-series
harmonized throughout OECD, i.e. reasonable degree of comparability
increasingly possible to distinguish between process and product, basic vs. applied research, research vs. development
possible to divide between industries, government, higher education, non-profit, sources of finance
Available in micro data on firm level
 -->

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

**Validity**
{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Not necessarily innovation

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Not the only innovation input

**Reliability**

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Biased against small firms

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Biased against service / organizational innovation

**Objectivity**

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Measurement error due to false allocation of spending




<!-- Partially concerned with early stages â€“ not necessarily innovation
not the only input: 
trial production
market analysis
training of employees
investment in fixed assets

bias against small firms - less formal innovation processes
bias against more service- and/or organizationally-oriented innovation
sometimes hard to pin-point to location of actual activity: in particular regions and sometimes countries
Risk that respondents answer wrongly: e.g., R&D contracted to others, by others, in own organization

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Differing propensity to patent

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Patenting motivation

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Possible Industry-Technology mismatch

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Multiple patent offices (EPO; USPTO; JPO)


<!-- not all innovations are patentable
not all patentable innovations are patented
there are differences in the propensity to patent depending on:
industry
firm size (but patents/R&D usually higher for small)
invention type (e.g. product-life cycle position)
what can be patented has evolved over time
the cost of imitation
technological opportunities
