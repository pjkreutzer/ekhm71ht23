# Subject Oriented Measurements {.inverted}

## Surveys 

![](assets/noun-survey-2714919.png)



**** 

### Example: European Community Innovation Survey

:::

:::notes
**CIS**

- EU + Norway + Iceland: drew from Yale survey. 
 
- Since early 1990s
 
- Based on Oslo manual.
 
- In addition 
  
  - innovation expenditures (R&D + other efforts)
  
  - Sales of imitative and innovative products
  
  - Product/process innovation
:::

### Three Main Uses of Surveys

1. Descriptive overviews

2. Studies for policy analysis

3. Econometric / statistical analysis

### Surveys summary

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Flexible

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Rich



:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Response rate

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Delimination of innovation expenditure

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Subjectivity of novelty


:::

::::


:::notes
**Advantages**

- richer distinctions (innovative/imitative)

- non-R&D inputs addressed

- service industries addressed

- data on: organizational innovation, technological collaboration, obstacles to innovation

**Disadvantages**

- low response rates

- share of innovative products sensitive to stage of business cycle

- difficult to say what is an innovation expenditure

- goods & services new to which ’market’?

:::

## R & D

> Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.

### Types of R & D {.smaller}

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="30%"}
**Basic Research**
[is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge about observable phenomena and facts, [not directed toward any particular use]{.text-emphasis}.]{.fragment}
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
**Applied Research**
[is original investigation to acquire new knowledge [directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective]{.text-emphasis}.]{.fragment}

:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
**Experimental Development**
[is systematic effort, based on existing knowledge from research or practical experience, [directed toward creating novel or improved]{.text-emphasis} materials, products, devices, processes, systems, or services.]{.fragment}
:::

::::


:::notes

**Example** 

- Basic research: understanding molecular structures in polymers

- Applied research: finding an application of polymers to plastics and proving its feasibility

- Experimental research: developing and testing materials based on polymers

### R & D Summary


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Long Time Series

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Decomposable (Type of Research, Org)

{{< bi check-lg color=green >}} Available at Firm Level

<!-- Advantages:
long time-series
harmonized throughout OECD, i.e. reasonable degree of comparability
increasingly possible to distinguish between process and product, basic vs. applied research, research vs. development
possible to divide between industries, government, higher education, non-profit, sources of finance
Available in micro data on firm level
 -->

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Not necessarily innovation

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Not the only innovation input

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Biased against small firms

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Biased against service / organizational innovation

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Measurement error due to false allocation of spending


<!-- Partially concerned with early stages – not necessarily innovation
not the only input: 
trial production
market analysis
training of employees
investment in fixed assets

bias against small firms - less formal innovation processes
bias against more service- and/or organizationally-oriented innovation
sometimes hard to pin-point to location of actual activity: in particular regions and sometimes countries
Risk that respondents answer wrongly: e.g., R&D contracted to others, by others, in own organization

## Patents summary

:::notes
-  Patents are used differently across fields. In some fields, they are important ways in which firms appropriate returns from R&D. In others, they are less important for these purposes but are used for other strategic purposes. 

- A considerable amount of innovation occurs outside the patent system. Strengthening of patent protection leads to changes in patenting and patent propensity, but this is not necessarily correlated with more innovation.

{{< bi x-lg color=red >}} Multiple patent offices (EPO; USPTO; JPO)


<!-- not all innovations are patentable
not all patentable innovations are patented
there are differences in the propensity to patent depending on:
industry
firm size (but patents/R&D usually higher for small)
invention type (e.g. product-life cycle position)
what can be patented has evolved over time
the cost of imitation
technological opportunities
