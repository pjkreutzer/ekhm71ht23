**Reading Question**

The chapter is very optimistic as to the possibilities of green innovation solving climate change.
How do they motivate their optimism?
What do you think?
Do you buy into it?
Why not?

> Jevons paradox
Offsetting efficiency gains with increased demands

# Directionality {.inverted}

## Directed Technical Change

:::notes

Presents a model of two technology alternatives. One clean and one polluting.
What are some important limitations of this model for reality? In other words what are the basic assumptions made for this model to work?

> that there exist a finite number of alternatives
> that there exists a knowable right answer

What does path dependence mean for innovation systems at large?
What levers can you think of that might help break out of path dependence, when you take a broad systems view?
:::

### Example paper: @moscona2022DoesDirectedInnovation

[Question]{.text-gray-500} Is innovation in plants directed to increase yield, or resilience of crops?

[Data]{.text-gray-500} U.S. patent data, Plant variety protection certificates & U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Variety Name List

[Main Finding]{.text-gray-500}
Innovation directed to more resilient crops, driven by local climate conditions

:::notes
Discussion of data used.

What is measured by this data?
What type of innovation is this biased against?
:::

## Directionality

>  : relating to direction or guidance especially of thought or effort 


:::notes

> Later this led to the mantrathat government policy should be “technology neutral” (Azar and Sand ́en, 2011), which in effect means that the directionof technological progress in not an issue for politicaldebate and deliberation. ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NGHM33SP?page=3&annotation=H5G2X4WH))

([Andersson et al., 2021, p. 110](zotero://select/library/items/MHKC2Q5V))

**Reading questions**

What is the position of @aghion2021PowerCreativeDestruction on directionality?
How is this discussion treated?
What are their normative (implicit) assumptions about technology, innovation and sustainability?

@aghion2021PowerCreativeDestruction mention path dependence.
What does this mean?
How does it arise?
How does this fit into the study of innovation?


@aghion2021PowerCreativeDestruction discuss the use of intermediate technology, how do you think about this in terms of developing countries?

What is meant by sociotechnical systems?
> interaction of society and technology, through institutions, material and behavior

## Eco-Innovation and Directionality in an African Context {.smaller}

![@mulugetta2022AfricaNeedsContextrelevant](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41560-022-01152-0/MediaObjects/41560_2022_1152_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp){}

:::notes
**Reading Question**
On the diffusion of green innovation, they argue that every country has an incentive to free ride on others efforts.
When taking a global perspective, it seems a geopolitically motivated race emerges between china and the us who will be the front runners of green innovation. How does this fit in with the free rider narrative?

The figure illustrates stylized country-specific solution spaces of the set of different meaningful energy system pathways to meet development goals. It assumes the long-term vision of African countries to achieve clean and sustainable energy systems with universal electricity access. Larger solution space areas indicate larger degrees of uncertainty as to which energy system pathways optimize development outcomes. In Ethiopia, the short-term and long-term favourability of focusing on renewable energy limits these uncertainties, whereas Mozambique has a much wider range of potential pathway options with salient short-term versus long-term development opportunity and risk trade-offs. Pathways are illustrative only
