## Post Game Reflections

1. What happened?
2. How did you feel in your role?
3. Do you feel you “won”?
4. What moment was decisive for the game outcome?
5. What were you thinking about the other players in the game?
6. Did something that could have happened not happen (e.g., the government passing laws? Citizens stopping to consume at all?) Why or why not


## Reading Reflections
1. What knowledge was developed in the game? By whom and when?
2. How is knowledge diffused both in the game and in reality?
3. What would have happened if one (or both) of the indicators were more delayed?
4. What would have been needed to have a different game?
5. How aware were you of the game mechanisms during the game versus after? What changed?
